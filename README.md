Project title : Eyes Movement 


<img src="eyes.png" width=50 height=50>


Desprection:

In this assignment we worked a lot with styling and incorporating Java Script, HTMl, and CSS to work together to animate these unblinking eyes to follow the movement of the mouse cursor when it moves across the webpage. CSS was used to style the page layout; HTML div element was used for the focus of the eye-movement exercise; JavaScript function to update the position of the HTML element whenever the mouse moves.

 How to run: 

This will run locally in your browser from index.html if you download all files and ensure they're located in the same directory as each other and have the same file structure. When you open your index.html in the webbrowser you will see two eyes that follow the movement of your mouse.

Roadmap of future improvements: 

This is a progression project, no further development is anticipated at this time.
